### How To Download:
Downloading files from github directly onto an android device can be tricky. A quick way is to click the
generated DownGit link below:

https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/pknepps/Shopping-List/blob/main/Shopping-List.apk

If you don't trust downGit, you may download this repository to your local pc, then pick any file 
transfer method to move the Shopping-List.apk  file to your android device.

Run the .apk package on your android device to install. You may need to enable "Install from unknown apps" (Android 8.0 or higher) 
or "Install from unknown sources" (Android 7.1.1 or lower) within your device settings.

### Usage:
Begin by adding all items to your shopping list in the "Items" column of the table. New rows 
for items will automatically be added as text boxes are filled.  

While shopping, fill the "Price" column with the shelf-value of each respective item. 
The totals at the bottom of thescreen will be updated to reflect the total cost of the items in your cart, with tax. 

To remove an item, simply click the "X" at the end of the row.

If needed, you may change the tax rate by clicking on the tax value (default is 0.07) close to the bottom of the 
screen, and typing the desired tax rate. 

Once you are finished shopping, you may click the "CLEAR" button to remove all items with declared prices from the list,
indicating that you have purchased those items.
